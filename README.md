# Factorio Raw Data
Yet another dump of `data.raw` from Factorio. This one however uses the keys to organize the prototypes into files. `data.raw[type][name]` translates to the file `data/type/name`.

If you're looking for a specific prototype on GitHub, press `t` to search by file name.


# Generation
This dump is created using my [Data Analysis Tool](https://github.com/DedlySpyder/FactorioTooling/tree/main/tools/data_analysis), uisng a `final` dump without any extra mods.
